}
```

## **🎯 CRITICAL GAPS ANALYSIS**

### **1. WebSocket Real-Time Integration (HIGH PRIORITY)**
**Current State**: Backend real-time processor functional, frontend polling only
**Gap**: WebSocket endpoints and React client implementation
**Impact**: Dashboard appears static instead of live intelligence
**Effort**: 4-6 hours

```typescript
// NEEDED: Real-time WebSocket Integration
const useRealTimeIntelligence = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    const ws = new WebSocket(process.env.REACT_APP_WS_URL);
    ws.onmessage = (event) => {
      const update = JSON.parse(event.data);
      // Handle real-time intelligence updates
    };
  }, []);
};
```

### **2. Complete API Error Handling (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
**Current State**: Basic API integration with minimal error handling
**Gap**: Comprehensive error boundaries and loading states
**Impact**: Poor user experience during API failures
**Effort**: 2-3 hours

```typescript
// NEEDED: Enhanced Error Handling
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);

const handleAPIError = (error: Error) => {
  setError(error.message);
  // User-friendly error display
};
```

### **3. Advanced Entity Views (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
**Current State**: Basic entity lists with limited detail
**Gap**: Detailed drill-down views and relationship exploration
**Impact**: Limited user engagement with intelligence data
**Effort**: 6-8 hours

### **4. Production Authentication Flow (HIGH PRIORITY)**
**Current State**: Backend OAuth working, React integration partial
**Gap**: Complete React authentication flow
**Impact**: Cannot deploy to production without proper auth
**Effort**: 3-4 hours
