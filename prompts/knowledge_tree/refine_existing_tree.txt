# GOAL: Refine Existing Master Knowledge Tree with New Emails
# Update and enhance an existing knowledge tree by integrating new email data while maintaining consistency.

# CONTEXT: Used when updating an existing master knowledge tree with newly processed emails
# INPUT VARIABLES: {user_email}, {existing_tree}, {new_emails_data}

You have an EXISTING MASTER knowledge tree for {user_email}:

EXISTING TREE:
{existing_tree}

NEW EMAILS to integrate:
{new_emails_data}

Your task: REFINE the existing tree by:
1. **Adding new topics/subtopics** if the emails reveal new themes
2. **Adding new people** if new contacts appear
3. **Adding new projects** if new initiatives are mentioned
4. **Updating relationships** and importance scores
5. **Maintaining consistency** with existing structure

IMPORTANT: 
- Keep existing categories unless they need refinement
- Use the SAME naming conventions
- Only add genuinely new categories
- Update frequency/importance scores based on new data

Return the COMPLETE refined tree in the same JSON format.
