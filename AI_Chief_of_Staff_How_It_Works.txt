                    AI CHIEF OF STAFF - HOW IT WORKS
                         End-to-End Product Overview
=============================================================================

WHAT IS IT?
-----------
An AI-powered personal assistant that reads your emails, understands your 
business relationships, and helps you make better decisions. Think of it as 
having a smart assistant who knows everyone you work with and can spot 
important patterns in your communications.


HOW IT WORKS (STEP BY STEP):
============================

STEP 1: LOGIN & SETUP
----------------------
• You login with your Google account
• The system gets permission to read your Gmail and Google Calendar
• It creates a secure profile just for you

STEP 2: EMAIL QUALITY FILTERING (THE SECRET SAUCE)
--------------------------------------------------
Before processing ANY emails, the system does something smart:

• It analyzes who you actually respond to vs who you ignore
• It creates 3 tiers of contacts:
  - TIER 1: People you regularly respond to (high quality)
  - TIER 2: New contacts or people you sometimes respond to (medium quality)  
  - TIER LAST: People you consistently ignore (low quality = spam/noise)

• ONLY emails from Tier 1 and Tier 2 contacts get processed by AI
• Tier LAST emails are filtered out completely (no "shitty content" processed)

This means the AI only learns from your REAL business relationships, not spam.

STEP 3: EMAIL SYNC & AI PROCESSING
----------------------------------
• System fetches your recent emails (you control how many and how far back)
• For each QUALITY email (Tier 1/2 only):
  - Claude AI reads and understands the content
  - Extracts important people, topics, and action items
  - Creates tasks if someone asked you to do something
  - Identifies business opportunities and relationships
  - Builds a knowledge base of your professional world

• Emails from people you ignore (Tier LAST) are stored but NOT processed by AI

STEP 4: INTELLIGENCE GENERATION
-------------------------------
The AI continuously analyzes your data to create:

• STRATEGIC INSIGHTS: "You have 3 high-priority decisions pending"
• RELATIONSHIP INTELLIGENCE: "You haven't contacted John from BigCorp in 30 days"
• BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES: "5 people mentioned the new product launch"
• MEETING PREPARATION: Auto-generates prep materials for upcoming meetings
• TASK EXTRACTION: Finds action items people asked you to do

STEP 5: CALENDAR INTELLIGENCE
-----------------------------
• Syncs with Google Calendar
• Analyzes upcoming meetings
• Creates preparation tasks automatically
• Provides context about who you're meeting with
• Suggests discussion points based on recent emails

STEP 6: SMART DASHBOARD
-----------------------
You get a beautiful web interface that shows:

• DASHBOARD: High-level overview of insights and metrics
• TASKS: Action items extracted from emails with full context
• PEOPLE: Your professional network with engagement scores and relationship intelligence
• CALENDAR: Upcoming meetings with AI-generated preparation notes
• TOPICS: Business themes and projects the AI has identified
• SETTINGS: Control sync frequency, view contact tiers, clean up data
