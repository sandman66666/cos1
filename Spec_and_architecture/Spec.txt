Absolutely, Oudi. Here’s a full product spec for building your AI Chief of Staff from scratch — clean, modular, and aligned with your vision. It’s framed as if you’re handing it to a top-tier dev or AI engineer for a greenfield build, with the expectation of scaling into something serious later.

🧠 AI Chief of Staff – Technical Product Specification (v1.0)

🎯 Goal

Build an AI-powered Chief of Staff that ingests data from multiple sources (email, calendar, Slack, files), builds a contextual knowledge graph, and provides strategic and tactical support via a smart interface — helping founders, execs, and operators stay ahead without drowning in details.

🧩 Architecture Overview

1. Modular Backend Stack
	•	Language: Python 3.10+
	•	Framework: FastAPI (for modular APIs)
	•	Scheduler: Celery with Redis (for background sync jobs)
	•	Database:
	•	PostgreSQL (for structured data: tasks, meetings, metadata)
	•	FAISS / Weaviate / Qdrant (for vector embeddings)
	•	Neo4j (or NetworkX) for knowledge graph (optional in v1)
	•	Storage: S3-compatible blob storage for files
	•	Memory / LLM Integration: OpenAI GPT-4 (or Claude/Anthropic) with LangChain or LlamaIndex

2. Frontend
	•	Framework: Streamlit (v1) or React + Tailwind (if you’re hiring front-end devs)
	•	Auth: Google OAuth 2.0
	•	UI Components:
	•	Inbox / Digest View
	•	Calendar Timeline
	•	Knowledge Graph Explorer
	•	Smart Prompt Console
	•	Priority Feed / Next Action

⸻

📥 Data Ingestion

Sources (OAuth-based authentication):
	•	Gmail – using Gmail API
	•	Google Calendar – using Calendar API
	•	Slack – via Slack App tokens (read-only initially)
	•	Local files – PDF, DOCX, TXT (via drag & drop or folder watcher)
	•	Optional: Notion, Drive, Trello, Dropbox

Processor Flow:
	•	Every data source implements:
	•	fetch() → pulls new data
	•	normalize() → converts to a unified schema
	•	analyze() → extracts entities, tasks, timelines
	•	embed() → vectorizes for search

Metadata to capture:
	•	source, author, timestamp, type, link_to_original

⸻

🧠 Core Intelligence

1. Knowledge Graph
	•	Connect people ↔ projects ↔ messages ↔ files ↔ meetings
	•	Use spaCy or GPT to extract:
	•	Named Entities (people, orgs, locations)
	•	Relationships (“works with,” “reported,” “discussed”)

2. Memory & Context
	•	Implement per-user persistent memory:
	•	“What was the last update from Sarah?”
	•	“What did we say about Distro strategy last week?”
	•	Store summaries per conversation and allow retrieval via natural language.

3. Action Item Extraction
	•	From every email/Slack:
	•	Identify To-Dos, assign owners, extract due dates
	•	Example: “Let’s loop back Friday” → Task with due: this Friday

⸻

📆 Smart Scheduler
	•	Fetch open slots from Google Calendar
	•	Recommend time blocks to:
	•	Review flagged items
	•	Prepare for meetings
	•	Schedule follow-ups
	•	Add prompt like: “When should I review the investor deck?”

⸻

🧑‍💼 Prompt Interface
	•	Console with saved and custom prompts
	•	Example queries:
	•	“Summarize all unread emails since yesterday”
	•	“Prepare me for tomorrow’s board meeting”
	•	“Who do I need to follow up with this week?”
	•	Save custom prompts as templates

⸻

🔒 Privacy & Modes
	•	Offline Mode: No cloud sync, local only
	•	Cloud Mode: Data encrypted at rest & in transit
	•	Admin toggle for user to choose

⸻

🔧 Developer Requirements
	•	.env for keys
	•	Dockerfile for deploy
	•	README.md with:
	•	Setup
	•	OAuth instructions
	•	How to extend source connectors
	•	Unit and integration tests for:
	•	Ingest pipelines
	•	Prompt accuracy
	•	Task generation

⸻

📦 Deliverables for v1

Feature	Description
Gmail & Calendar Ingest	OAuth + data normalization
Slack Ingest	Basic channel fetch
File Upload	Drag/drop with chunking
Embedding + Vector DB	Searchable memory
Prompt UI Console	Text input, history, templates
Action Item Extractor	Pulls todos, follow-ups, deadlines
Scheduler + Suggestions	Calendar-aware time blocks
Summary Generator	Natural language digest of any source
Minimal UI	Dashboard with inbox, calendar, prompts
Local/Cloud toggle	User-selectable mode


⸻

🚀 Stretch Goals for v2
	•	Voice interface
	•	Meeting recorder (Zoom/GMeet) + summary
	•	Auto-email responder templates
	•	API for external integrations (Zapier-style)

⸻

💬 Example Prompts to Test
	•	“What are my top 3 priorities today?”
	•	“Summarize last week’s emails from Ran.”
	•	“What did John ask me to follow up on?”
	•	“Any unresponded threads in Slack from the past 3 days?”

⸻

🧠 Implementation Tips
	•	Start with 1 source (Gmail) and build E2E flow
	•	Make every feature modular
	•	Use LangChain agents or function-calling GPT for orchestration
	•	Keep logs for all GPT output with source traceability
