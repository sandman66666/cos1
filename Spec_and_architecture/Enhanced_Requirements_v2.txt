üéØ AI Chief of Staff - Enhanced Requirements v2.0

Based on user feedback and real-world usage, these are the critical improvements needed to make the system truly useful for business intelligence and productivity.

üö´ Email Quality & Filtering Issues

Current Problem:
- System processes too many useless emails (newsletters, notifications, automated messages)
- Clutters insights and makes it hard to find actionable information
- Wastes Claude API calls on low-value content

Enhanced Solution:
- Claude evaluates email significance BEFORE processing
- Smart detection of:
  ‚Ä¢ Newsletter/marketing emails (unsubscribe links, promotional language)
  ‚Ä¢ Automated notifications (system-generated, no-reply addresses)
  ‚Ä¢ Low-value content (spam-like, purely informational with no action needed)
- Focus only on "serious" business communications that require attention or action
- Priority scoring: High (urgent business), Medium (important updates), Low (FYI)

Implementation:
- Add email significance detection to Claude prompt
- Filter emails before normalization and intelligence processing
- Add quality score to Email model
- Dashboard shows only filtered, high-value emails

üìã Task Context & Clarity Issues

Current Problem:
- Tasks appear without context about who sent them or why
- No meaningful summary of the email that generated the task
- No way to reference back to the original email
- Tasks feel disconnected from their source

Enhanced Solution:
- Every task includes full sender context:
  ‚Ä¢ Sender name, email, title, company (from signature parsing)
  ‚Ä¢ Relationship type (colleague, client, vendor, etc.)
- Email context for each task:
  ‚Ä¢ Meaningful summary of the email that generated the task
  ‚Ä¢ Why this task is important/urgent
  ‚Ä¢ Original due date text with context
- Direct links to source emails:
  ‚Ä¢ Gmail search URLs for instant access
  ‚Ä¢ Preserves full email thread context

Task Display Format:
```
Task: "Send Q3 investor update draft"
From: Sarah Chen (sarah@venture.com) - Investor Relations, GreenTech Ventures
Context: "Follow-up on board meeting discussion about Q3 performance metrics. Sarah requested draft by Friday for partner review."
Due: Friday, June 7th (originally: "let's get this done by end of week")
Priority: High (Confidence: 0.9)
Source: [Link to Gmail thread]
```

üë• People Network Issues

Current Problem:
- System creates contacts from newsletter accounts instead of real people
- Missing professional context (titles, companies, roles)
- No distinction between business contacts and automated senders
- Email signatures not being parsed for professional information

Enhanced Solution:
- Real person detection:
  ‚Ä¢ Exclude newsletters, automated systems, no-reply addresses
  ‚Ä¢ Focus on human senders with genuine email addresses
  ‚Ä¢ Detect personal vs. professional communications
- Signature parsing:
  ‚Ä¢ Extract titles, company names, phone numbers
  ‚Ä¢ Parse email signatures for professional context
  ‚Ä¢ Store and display professional hierarchy information
- Relationship analysis:
  ‚Ä¢ Classify relationship types (colleague, client, vendor, partner)
  ‚Ä¢ Communication frequency and importance scoring
  ‚Ä¢ Project associations and collaboration patterns

People Profile Format:
```

üîó Email Linking & Reference System

Current Problem:
- No way to access original emails from tasks, insights, or people profiles
- Context is lost once information is processed
- Cannot verify AI interpretations against source material

Enhanced Solution:
- Gmail search URLs for every reference:
  ‚Ä¢ Tasks link to source email thread
  ‚Ä¢ People profiles link to email history
  ‚Ä¢ Business insights link to supporting emails
  ‚Ä¢ Email summaries link to original messages
- URL Format: `https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#search/from:sender+subject:keywords`
- Search query optimization:
  ‚Ä¢ Use sender + subject for specific emails
  ‚Ä¢ Use sender + date range for people history
  ‚Ä¢ Use keywords + date for topic-based searches

Link Integration Points:
- Tasks: "View source email" button
- People: "Email history" and "Recent communications" links
- Business insights: "Supporting emails" links
- Email summaries: "Open in Gmail" button

üè∑Ô∏è Topic Management & Organization

Current Problem:
- Topics are generated inconsistently (e.g., "venture capital" vs "investment" vs "VC")
- No way to organize or merge related topics
- Cannot control how content is categorized
- Topic insights are fragmented across similar themes

Enhanced Solution:
- Official Topics System:
  ‚Ä¢ User can mark topics as "official" for consistent use
  ‚Ä¢ Official topics guide Claude's content classification
  ‚Ä¢ Topic descriptions for precise categorization
- Topic Merging:
  ‚Ä¢ Merge related topics: "venture capital" + "VC" + "investment" ‚Üí "Investment"
  ‚Ä¢ All historical content automatically recategorized
  ‚Ä¢ Prevents future fragmentation of similar topics
- Topic Hierarchy:
  ‚Ä¢ Parent-child relationships: "Investment" ‚Üí "Series A", "Series B", "Angel"
  ‚Ä¢ Better organization of complex business themes
- Content Matching:
  ‚Ä¢ Claude evaluates content against official topic definitions
  ‚Ä¢ Confidence scoring for topic assignments
  ‚Ä¢ User can review and adjust topic assignments

Topic Management Interface:
```
Official Topics:
‚úì Investment (merged: venture capital, VC, funding)
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Series A Funding
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Angel Investment
‚úì Product Development (merged: product, development, roadmap)
‚úì Customer Success (merged: client, customer, support)

Suggested Merges:
‚Ä¢ "AI" + "artificial intelligence" + "machine learning" ‚Üí AI & ML
‚Ä¢ "sales" + "revenue" + "deals" ‚Üí Sales & Revenue
```
