user claude 4 sonnet as the AI agent even when spec gives other options. 

powering as much with cluade and AI to make this product great and unique. 

make sure to test each step automatically and at every step test the full flow. 

store the test files in a test files folder 

don't use fake data as fallback, always use real data

the goal of this product is to be the best AI assistant for work, try to find an interesting take when possible to make product more unique 

remember i don't code, so no need to explain, just update code and move to next task 

when you create a new file that replaces an old one, delete the old one. if you can't move it to an archive folder you create. 

review the spec.txt file from time to time to make sure we're on the right path 

it's ok to start with a basic html page to test functionality 

before coding from scratch reviewe the code in the folder '/Users/oudiantebi/Session42 Dropbox/Oudi Antebi/Mac (3)/Documents/MyCode/ChiefOfStaff/personal-ai-assistant' to see if there is something there to reuse. 

before letting me run the server to test, make sure you review your code 3 times and ensure it's clean and good. 

never create huge files with tons of code. architect the product like the best coder in the world and keep things in different files to avoid huge code files 

the system is multi tenent from the get go. meaning that we store things per authenticated user that authenticates wtih their gmail. 

the system will run in heroku once we validate that it's working locally. 

if we use files instread of a DB but we need a DB eventually to run on cloud, make sure we implement this already.
