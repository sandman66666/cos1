üîß AI Chief of Staff - Development Rules & Guidelines (v4.0 - Smart Contact Strategy)

Production Application Guidelines for Revolutionary Engagement-Driven Processing

‚∏ª

üéØ Core Development Principles

1. Engagement-First Architecture (NEW IN v4.0)
   ‚Ä¢ Use engagement patterns (sent emails) as the foundation for all intelligence decisions
   ‚Ä¢ Build Trusted Contact Database from sent email analysis first
   ‚Ä¢ Weight all AI processing based on demonstrated user engagement
   ‚Ä¢ Cost-optimize by focusing AI resources on content that matters to the user's business
   ‚Ä¢ "If I don't engage with it, it probably doesn't matter to my business intelligence"

2. AI-First Approach Enhanced with Smart Filtering
   ‚Ä¢ Use Claude 4 Sonnet as the primary AI agent for intelligent processing
   ‚Ä¢ Apply Smart Contact Strategy to eliminate noise before AI processing
   ‚Ä¢ Leverage AI for business intelligence on content with proven relevance
   ‚Ä¢ Always prefer engagement-driven solutions over brute-force approaches
   ‚Ä¢ Track and optimize AI processing costs through smart classification

3. Rich Context & Progressive Disclosure
   ‚Ä¢ Build expandable context cards that tell the complete story
   ‚Ä¢ Implement progressive disclosure to show intelligence depth
   ‚Ä¢ Create knowledge repositories for topics, not just tags
   ‚Ä¢ Store comprehensive context for people, tasks, and topics
   ‚Ä¢ Enable users to understand insights without reading source emails

4. Quality & Testing Standards
   ‚Ä¢ Test each enhancement automatically and at every step
   ‚Ä¢ Test the full flow end-to-end after any changes
   ‚Ä¢ Store all test files in the test_files/ folder with real data
   ‚Ä¢ Never use fake data as fallback - always use real Gmail data for testing
